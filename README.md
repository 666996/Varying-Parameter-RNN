INTRODUCTION
-----
Many practical control problems can be solved by being formulated as time-varying quadratic minimization and time-varying quadratic programing problems. In this project, a power-type varying-parameter recurrent neural network is proposed and analyzed to effectively solve the resulting time-varying problems, as well as the original practical problems. For a clear understanding, we introduce this model from three aspects: design, analysis, and applications. Specifically, the reason why and the method we use to design this neural network model for solving online TVQP problems subject to time-varying linear equality/inequality are described in detail. The theoretical analysis confirms that when activated by six commonly used activation functions, the proposed network achieves a superexponential convergence rate. In contrast to the traditional zeroing neural network with fixed design parameters, the proposed model has better convergence performance. Comparative simulations with state-of-the-art methods confirm the advantages. Furthermore, the application of the proposed to a robot motion planning problem verifies the feasibility, applicability, and efficiency.
